### Logging

From Version openHAB-2.2.0.006 the SPK generates two log files located at `/var/log/`.

The first log file `openHAB2-install.log` will be generated during the installation. If you can't install the openHAB2 SPK, please have a look inside the file.

The second log `openHAB2-start-stop.log` will be generated by starting and stopping openHAB2 inside the Package Manager.
